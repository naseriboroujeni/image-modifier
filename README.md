# Image Processing Parallel

## Overview

This C++ project focuses on efficient image processing, implementing a color manipulation algorithm on large datasets. The goal is to achieve optimal performance through various optimizations, multithreading, and data structure choices.

## Key Features

1. **Algorithm Efficiency:**
   - Designed to efficiently apply color manipulation to each pixel of large image datasets.

2. **Memory Management:**
   - Utilizes optimized data structures for efficient handling of image datasets in memory.

3. **Multithreading:**
   - Utilizes multithreading to concurrently process different sections of the image dataset, enhancing performance.

4. **Custom Data Structure:**
   - Implements a custom data structure for managing intermediate results efficiently during image processing.

5. **File I/O Operations:**
   - Implements file I/O operations for reading and writing image data.
